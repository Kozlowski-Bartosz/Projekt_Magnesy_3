## Projekt_Magnesy_3

A simple program allowing to dynamically view and edit the signals of a sine wave, combination of two sine waves ("etap1.py"), or a predefined signal ("etap2.py").

The signal of "etap2.py" is defined with the following formula:

```math
w(t) = A * K * \frac{(\frac{t}{t_1})^n}{1+(\frac{t}{t_1})^n}*\exp(-\frac{t}{t_2})*\cos(2\pi f*t+\varphi)
```

The program was made as a part of the Electromagnetism course at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.
